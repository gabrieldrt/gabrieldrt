# Hello there! Welcome to My GitHub :) 

I'm Gabriel ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, a Web Development & Design student at the Lisbon School of Design ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, starting my journey in web development and UX/UI design. Here, you'll find a bit of what I'm learning and creating as I take my first steps.

## Who Am I?

I'm a curious and passionate tech/arts enthusiast, currently focused on:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
- Design and prototyping with Figma;
- Front-end development.

I'm still building my portfolio, but I'm excited to share what I'll create along the way.

## What You'll Find Here

This space is for:

- Storing my projects and experiments.
- Documenting what I've learned and what I'm exploring.
- Connecting with others who are on the same journey.

## My Plans

Here are a few project ideas I want to develop soon:

- **Portfolio Website:** A space to showcase my projects and share what I'm learning.

## Let's Connect!

If you want to chat, give suggestions, or just say hi, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieldrt/) or send me an email at [gabrieluisduartet@gmail.com](mailto:gabrieluisduartet@gmail.com).
